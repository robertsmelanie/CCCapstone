            <h3>Why Gardening?</h3>
            <p>
              Why Gardening? - Humanity has instinctively turned to gardening when faced with insecurity and turmoil - Food shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many people to pursue more self-determination over their food supply - Growing your own food also has additional environmental benefits, allowing you to eat locally and reduce your carbon footprint Healthy Food Access for All - In the US, many unhealthy foods are made with subsidized ingredients - Government subsidies of "commodity" crops bring down the price of things like white bread, high fructose corn syrup, and factory farmed meat while also creating a marketplace distortion that makes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts and seeds comparatively more expensive - Community gardens can help here, too, by bringing healthy food into the very communities that need it the most, reducing reliance on convenience stores and fast food Bring People Together - Community gardens encourage community investment in a common goal, thus bringing people together who might not otherwise interact so closely - One of the natural outcomes of this is getting to know your neighbors, learning to look out for each other, and enjoying the added benefits of building new friendships and partnerships within your community Improve Food Security - Community gardens also help address some of the problems with food deserts, areas where it's hard or close to impossible to find healthy food. - In places with food insecurity, community gardens can be a lifeline, helping to address hunger in many households. An increase in food security can occur when a community garden is within walking distance of residential areas. Good for the environment - Converting vacant lots into community gardens not only removes an eyesore but can also help restore degraded soil that can become safeguarded for the production of food. - Restoring soil quality and fertility also yields benefits such as increased carbon sequestration, reduced storm water runoff, and improved water-holding capacity. Offer Health Benefits - Eating more fresh produce is associated with better self-esteem, mood, and general health - People who enjoy fruits and vegetables often experience reduced stress and improved resilience - Kids who grow fruits and veggies themselves are more likely to eat produce if they have a hand in growing them - A diet that includes fresh fruit and vegetables has a positive impact on the gut microbiome Community Gardens Are Powerful - One of the best things you can do right now is just to empower others to cultivate their existing gardens - We can take responsibility for what is right in front of us, and make it grow into something strong, beautiful, and bountiful.

            <h3>Benefits of a Community Garden</h3>
            <p>
              Community gardens are becoming more common and sought after by both residents and city officials because they provide a variety of functions within a community that society values. These gardens are promoted as having economic advantages, providing health benefits, offering educational opportunities, and reducing food deserts. In particular, community-supported agriculture theoretically could address inequalities about food security What is a community garden? Community gardens are places where people come together to grow a variety of vegetables, herbs, fruits, and flowers. They do this by renting individual or shared plots of land within the community garden. The introduction of community gardens may be able to reduce the impact of food deserts in low-income areas and allow residents greater access to nutritious food that is necessary to live a healthy life. Benefits of a community garden Community gardens create a sense of community among neighbors who are increasingly disconnected from each other They provide healthy options in neighborhoods that are often food scarce Many cities are filled with empty spaces - perfectly fine land that is unused and filling up with ugly debris Turning that land into urban gardening space that residents could share would be a win-win for everyone For a healthy lifestyle Community gardens provide fresh, safe, and affordable herbs, fruits, and vegetables Making fresh produce accessible: Community gardens provide healthy, fresh produce to many families who could not have the money to buy it, thus increasing their diets and overall well-being. They also help reduce the need for food by donating their surplus products to local food banks. Beautifying the landscape Vacant land that is not kept up can not only be an eyesore but can create hazardous conditions for residents. Community gardens bring vacant land to life by providing a safe and beautiful place to gather for humans and beneficial plants, insects, and animals. Gardening knowledge What time and amount to water, planting in full sun or shade healthy soil, nutrition, as well as pest control and beneficial insects, are just some of the many subjects you'll need to know about You'll be in the company of people of different degrees of knowledge about gardening Helping Reduce Crime: Gardens in urban areas are positively correlated with decreased crime rates. Community gardens allow for the creation of social ties and build a greater feeling of community. These connections help reduce crime, empower residents, and allow residents to feel safe in their neighborhoods. Cleaning up the environment Plants naturally provide fresh air people breathe They help to create clean air by eliminating pollutants from the air The plants also absorb rainwater, which means there's less runoff on the streets Community gardeners also reduce waste overall Increased pollinator plants improve conditions for bees Stronger Communities Sharing a community garden gives people a chance to connect with their neighbors Health and wellness Community gardens improve the availability of fresh and high-quality foods, which can help cut down on costs for food and increase the security of food for those who need it the most Educational opportunities: Gardening in a community can be a great opportunity to teach children about the source of their food and to gain a fundamental introduction to the environment, work abilities, and basic business principles. It is also a great way to educate adults too. Relieving stress and increasing wellness: Gardening invites people to slow down, connect with nature, and foster relationships with like-minded individuals. Preserves green space: Maintaining and developing garden space is cheaper than other options because the majority of the cost comes from labor Provides opportunities for connection: Community gardens offer unique opportunities to establish relationships within and across physical and social barriers, including: Inter-generational exposure to cultural traditions, Cultural exchange with other gardeners, Access to non-English speaking communities, and access to green common spaces.
